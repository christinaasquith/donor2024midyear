<h2>X teenagers taking on technical challenges: 
</h2>
<p>
    For years, Hack Club has been an underground movement of several thousand teen hackers, but this month we launched our summer challenge the “Hack Club Arcade”in partnership with big names: GitHub, Minecraft Education, FIRST Robotics, and 10 other tech companies and nonprofit coding clubs. We expect 10k students to participate; with 500-1,000 rising to the challenge of completing a successful challenge, from graphics programming to program language development, AI and Ham radio. Within the first hour, teenagers from 60 different countries had started.

<p>This growth and professionalization of Hack Club is thanks to donors like you. </p>
